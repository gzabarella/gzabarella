  video installation on 3 sync tv screens (colour, sound), 3’33’’
brief: >
  This video-installation tries to construct a rhythm, a symphony, with the fragments and discarded traces of intimate family memories and amateurish footage: quick snippets of christmas decorations, still-lives, kitchen shots, color tests and white noise. Both in sound and in images the technical, graphical hints of the recording and the intimate raw material merge together. 
  These “detrituses” are to be grasped quickly, they are “what is not said, [...] what happens between the sentences” - as John Berger’s voice states in a quick sound excerpt - they are the ruins, electro-signals, test patterns, waste material, background noise between “proper” sentences, sneaking in what is supposed to be clean, linear storytelling and narrative.
