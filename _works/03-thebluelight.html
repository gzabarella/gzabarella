  8 colour night-lights, reading performance
brief: >
  This work functions as a dialogue and a reaction to Dan Flavin’s light installations, some of which part of the private collection that hosted the exhibition. As a response to Flavin’s vertical, awe-inspiring, cold neon-lighted objects (as well as to the visually and physically imposing artworks by other American Minimalists like Carl Andre and Donald Judd), I scattered cheap and colorful children night-lights around the exhibition space, ironically defining and marking it as a not-so-serious playground. On the opening evening, I turned all the room lights off and read a bedtime story to the visitors, sitting on the floor. The night-lights’ cheesiness mixes with a sudden feeling of intimacy and caring “femininity”, but also with a sense of disquiet: the fairytale “The Blue Light”, an original by the Brothers Grimm, is intertwined with some of the Minimalists’ strong artistic statements, a violence that interrupts the quiet flow of storytelling and uncovers dark areas of this piece of art history.
