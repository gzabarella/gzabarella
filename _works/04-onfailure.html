brief: >
  The consuming/devouring/digesting act of information is spread powerlessly around as popcorns, a formless outburst of indifference. Some questions float on transparent plastic sheets, unanswered. 
  A notebook includes a collection of youtube comments as a “Sketch of a possibile playwright” (an attempt of re-using found text to produce new dramaturgies). The geographical coordinates of all terror attacks happened in Europe from the end of 19th century figures as a silent wall of numbers.
  Terror attacks in Europe in the last 3 years disrupted the flow of daily routine, the usual socio-political narration, performing as the appearance of an external, “foreign” force. 
  Collecting fragments, like found video footage, found text, different data, pictures, and questioning the roles of spectators/actors/storytellers/performers, I suddenly lost grip of the material, the story I thought I could tell, reconstruct, or participate in. 
  Terrorism became the starting point of a more general research on how to structure stories, how to structure narratives, how to convey meaningful sense to events. A sense of general failure arouses, due to the impossibility of a linear discourse, the image (as imago, meaningful apparition, synthesis) being denied.
