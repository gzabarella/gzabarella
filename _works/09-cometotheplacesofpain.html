  car ride with audio track playing (stereo, 19’),<br/>
  fake tickets and receipts<br/>
  within the group show “La fange du macadam”,<br/>
  Josephspitalstraße 12, Munich, 25. July 2020<br/>
brief: >
  Visitors and passers-by of the group show in public space “La fange du macadam” 
  are invited to a car drive through the busy streets of Munich at rush hour one Saturday evening. 
  The car ride takes about 20 minutes and returns every time to the departure spot to drop off 
  the passengers, take on new ones and proceed with the loop. 
  The car is stuffed with piles of old receipts, tickets, parking bills that look like useless
  bits and leftovers of past drives and travels. As the journey unfolds and an audio track
  plays from the car speakers, fragments of stories of escape, border-crossing, forgotten interiors,
  abandoned houses and ruins emerge both through the male voice of a undefined narrator and through
  the receipts and tickets themselves, which work as some kind of libretto or script of the 
  disconnected and multi-voiced radio piece. What do we keep, when we leave a place? 
  What sticks to us of the past? Does that place change and morph in the meantime, 
  as some kind of autonomous self-healing body? 
  The texts result from a research residency in Georgia and Abkhazia in Autumn 2019.
