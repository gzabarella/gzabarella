brief: >
  Index means trace, symptom, imprint of the real. As photographic film chemically imprints reality onto a sensitive surface, so the written word appears as a physical trace of daily oral conversation, which flows continuously and restlessly, and that usually doesn’t leave any retraceable ruins. 
  The fragmented, mobile and decontextualized flow of these everyday conversations are written down with great accuracy: they are indeed unique biographies, intimate “archaeological finds”, personal imprints of different people, at the same time being facets and perspective of the artist’s own autobiography.
  Every worthless detail, digression, grammar mistake, cough and laugh are crystalised, instead of being omitted as in formal interview transcripts.
  The structure of the book itself, with its shape, the necessity of a title and an author, plays with the total discontinuity of its content.
  A sound track is to listen while reading the books: a fragmented and unrecognizable audio made of background noises, discarded sounds like cars in the streets or glasses in a bar, which fuse at times with the sound of the artist’s breathe.
