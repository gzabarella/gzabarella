brief: >
  “How many fingers, Winston?” is a quotation from one of the last chapters of 1984, the orwellian novel in which the main character, Winston, undergoes torture and brainwashing and is then made uncapable to clearly distinguish real from fiction, true from fake. 
  <br />When asked to reflect on the the students and workers riots of ‘68, the concepts of legacy and narrative were interesting to me: these battles appear to be seen through a nostalgic and celebratory filter, deliberately forgetful of any ambivalence, violence or contradiction. Fragments of activist slogans, newspaper articles, graffitis and political statements (from Pasolini to Charles de Gaulle, from the Situationists to anonymous students, from Paris to Rome and Munich) melt together in this work, where oppositions and polarities almost reset. In a disconnected and aggressive audio-recording, a hallucinatory Tower of Babel, and in weird posters spread throughout the city of Munich, these statements are repeated, chewed and tossed out again. They become powerless slogans, playful children advertisment, whose encounter in public space can raise questions, on the random passerby, about the power of politics and the recycling and reshaping of history.
