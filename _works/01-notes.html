technique: >
  two looped and sync slide-projections,<br /> plastic boxes,
  stack of papers, post-its
brief: >
  A series of photographs, taken in a textile factory in Italy and
  in the streets of Munich, constructs the raw material for this
  visual and narrative flow. Street signs, ads, handwritten
  instructions, logos, commonly used symbols get diconstructed,
  fall apart, disintegrate. Sillables and signs repeat and chase
  one another in this syncronised and rhythmically beaten double
  projection, where the distinction between form and content,
  referent and signifier, performative instruction and accidental
  contingency, imprint and speech simply collapses. Language
  becomes a failed architecture, an empty shell, a flashing
  nonsensical hallucination, a tiring and never-fulfilled effort.
