brief: >
  This video develops as an unsettling sequence of images and sounds, not very relatable or identifiable at the beginning. Some shots in a German cafeteria, where common objects stay still, construct a panorama of daily routine. Slowly and softly, a sense of anxiety grows: the soundtrack is based on amateurish audio- and video-recordings from the evening of November 13th, 2015: the attack at the Bataclan Concert Hall in Paris. The still and calm video, in which the daily flow is not put into question, melts with the disquieting sounds and background noises of shootings, screams, ambulances, and people in fear.
