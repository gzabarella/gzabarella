  with Veronika Galli
  <br />performance (30.000 A4 sheets, ladder, plastic bottle, other materials), soundtrack 30’
  <br />with Adam Putnam’s videowork “Reclaimed Empire” in the background
brief: >
  Starting points for this time-based work are Adam Putnam’s video “Reclaimed Empire” (part of a temporary exhibition at Kunstverein München), a fruitful, enormous database of countless visual references, and the visionary and eccentric approach by Aby Warburg to historiography and iconography, embedded in his Mnemosyne Atlas. Aby Warburg is the imaginary recipient of this performance, which is
  an attempt (at the same time naif, ironic and carefully thought-out) to both analyse and play with the idea of accumulation and distribution of information, meaning and memories, the attempt of creating order through a sistematic archive, and the need of free image association. 
  The sound-track itself is like a Russian “matrioshka” of family anectodes, notes and historical quotations spoken through the voices of the two artists, embodying the impossibility for an archive or an iconological research to follow strict linearity and coherence.
