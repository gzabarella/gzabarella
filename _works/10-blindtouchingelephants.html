brief: >
  A three-part shop window: lobby, waiting room, therapy studio. 
  Three inaccessible rooms offer themselves to the viewer as inactive and potential spaces. 
  Waiting areas where the furniture and interior decoration prescribe the actions and movements 
  of the bodies that are expected to occupy them. The glass façade of the underground gallery 
  separates and reflects two segments of time that flow at different speeds: that of the hurried 
  passersby chasing the subway, and that of the three rooms that act as static theatrical 
  backdrops, with their walls, curtains, and staged lights. For only one hour a day, 
  from noon to 1 p.m., the gallery is made accessible to the public, while gestures of care and 
  maintenance are daily performed like a ritual: vacuuming, watering plants, arranging magazines, 
  polishing mirrors and clocks, filling glasses with fresh water. Cleaning, tidying, 
  preparing are transformed from habitual and casual movements into precise performative acts, 
  repetitive as well as futile in the ever-empty spaces, slightly altering the arrangement of objects. 
  Different levels of voyeurism and the pathologization of bodies and gazes intertwine and mirror 
  each other between the interior and exterior of the gallery as well as between the 3 spaces – 
  between the one who observes, the one who is observed, the one who is performing maintenance or is 
  barely waiting, killing time.
